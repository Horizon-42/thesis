# Stage D's requests to the designer

Stage D's implementer writes this file (outline §5 rule 10, multi-aircraft control §0.3); it is rewritten in full each
time. Each item is a reading the implementer made where the design says nothing, or a gap; a reading is a proposal
until the user decides. Paths are relative to `4dTrajectory/ts_transformer/`.

State: 2026-10-06, MC0 parts A and B (vocabulary §6 item 5; prior §7 items 2, 3, 7) built on `dev-multi-control`.

## MC0 · stage A (vocabulary §6 item 5, D150)

1. **The executor's clock.** Multi-aircraft control §6.3 item 1 gives a flight's start cycle as "(join tick + s) × the
   cycles of a Δ row". Read: the loop's executor starts at tick s (the first predicted step of a flight of join tick 0,
   `Loop.steps` 0), so a flight's start cycle in the executor is j × the cycles of a Δ row; its first predicted step is
   the loop's tick j + s, as the design says. With every join tick 0 the executor's batch is the single-aircraft batch
   (no start cycle), so the loop is today's, bit for bit (`autopilot/start.py` module docstring, `Loop.started`).
2. **"Not heard" includes the column values.** A done or halted flight's words are not read by the grammar or the bound
   of go-arounds, but their values are still checked against their columns (D80). A flight that has not started is
   read not at all: neither the grammar, nor the bound, nor the values (its words are the caller's filler).

## MC0 · stage B (prior §7 items 2, 3, 7, D150)

3. **Which phase a loop with join ticks has.** `SpeakingLoop.observe` stays the phase of a loop whose join ticks are all
   0 (as the design says); a loop with any join tick above 0 has no `observe` phase: `step` runs from tick 0, each
   flight absent, observed or said by its own clock. A tick before tick s holds no said flight and does not step the
   executor. The speaking loop reads the join ticks from the start's `Loop` (one definition), not from its caller.
4. **The speaker's records of a row of several roles.** The records of a row (`forbidden`, the probability and the
   permission of "go-around", `procedure_blocked`, `drawn_probability`) are kept for every row in which some aircraft
   is said, `[B, …]` each, with `said_rows` (which aircraft were said in it); `Speaker.permitted` gives each aircraft
   its own said rows, first (padded as `Permitted.join` pads). As today, a done or ended flight that is still in the
   batch is said on (its later rows are recorded, not its sentence's). A flight not said in a row draws a word that no
   one keeps from every class of the model (no mask), so a flight that has not joined can never make a row refuse.
5. **An absent flight's inputs.** An aircraft that has not joined gets a row that is not present, computed from finite
   states (its observed row 0), so that its keys and values in the cache are finite (a masked key with a value that
   is not a number would still give a NaN through the attention's product).
6. **A landing added while a loop runs, on a sealed test day.** §6.3 item 5: "the index keeps its checks". Built so: a
   loop landing whose time falls on a sealed test day (a crossing just after a day cut) is refused by the index
   (`SealedDay`), which would stop a campaign. Stage C's own window landings (`post.landings.window_landings`) instead
   leave a shifted landing on a test day out and count it with the sealed landings. Proposal: the same for a landing
   of the loop — left out and counted as sealed — decided by the user before MC2 (the window loop of several commanded
   aircraft) uses it.
